# Solar-System-Prototype
This is just a base for an even better and more informative version...
  1) My try would be to make the planets in 3D
 
  2) There is a List of planets on the right side that: -
    1. Has the names of all the celestial bodies in the project.
    2. On clicking the name, I am able to see the planet magnified and the details at the place of the list.

  3) Addition of moons to the planets.
  4) Addition of the asteroid belt.
  5) Differentiation between inner ring orbit and outer ring orbit planets.
  6) No random place in the solar system.
